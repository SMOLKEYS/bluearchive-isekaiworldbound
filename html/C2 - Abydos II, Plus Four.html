</header>
<p>Ah, you’re back.</p>
<p>Well, let’s continue, shall we?</p>
<hr />
<p>Right now, I stand inside the Abydos High School main building,
dealing with another <em>minor</em> iss-</p>
<p>…okay, you know what? Maybe a major issue now.</p>
<p>“So, you guys are now a part of this too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And you have guns and haloes as well?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“And you know how to use them too?”</p>
<p>“Thanks to whatever god brought us here, yeah.”</p>
<p>“Oh, wait. Did you guys also regress back by 2 years?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I think so?”</p>
<p>“Well, this situation just got more interesting… or worse.”</p>
<p>“Indeed… you already thinking about how to explain this to the task
force?”</p>
<p>“…god have mercy upon my soul.”</p>
<p>An hour has already passed since my unexpected encounter with the
squad (alongside trying my best to explain my relations with them to the
Abydos students), and right now, all 5 of us are currently in one room,
assessing our situation. Meanwhile, the Abydos girls are in an entirely
different room, much to my surprise.</p>
<p>In that time, I’ve realized and discovered even more things.</p>
<p>One: I am no longer alone. Somehow, four of my other friends got
roped into this: Sazami Zen, Hotaru Shinchi (or Shin, for short),
Umazumi Akira, and Hanazono Levi. Prior to them meeting me, they were
mostly just wandering around until they all found each other at some
point, and then the school shortly after.</p>
<p>With them now being part of this mess, that may end up making things
ten times worse or chaotic.</p>
<p>Two: They got the exact same situation I had when I first woke up
here.</p>
<p>Wake up in some random abandoned building, notice a halo on their
head, notice the guns on the floor, pick them up, suddenly gain
knowledge on how to use them, realize they regressed back by 2 years, et
cetera.</p>
<p>Setting that aside, we completely begin an assessment on everything
we have.</p>
<p>For Akira, while we were talking, me and the others noticed a faint
orange glow on his left eye. When I asked about it…</p>
<p>“Wait… is that why I could shoot this thing so well?”</p>
<p>…for the sake of our already dwindling sense of logic, we just
chalked it up to it being able to significantly boost his accuracy.</p>
<p>As for Shin, well…</p>
<p>“Christ, that wing is about just as big as Hasumi’s own wings…”</p>
<p>“Well, ain’t worth much since I can’t even fuckin’ use it.
Wonderful.”</p>
<p>…what he got was a singular <em>massive</em> angel wing on the left
side of his body. For some reason, it was also tattered and damaged.</p>
<p>As for our age, well, with the 2 year age regression, that gives us
the following: - Me &amp; Akira - 18 -&gt; 16 - Zen &amp; Shin - 19
-&gt; 17 - Levi - 20 -&gt; 18</p>
<p>…I did not realize Levi entered his twenties before we got here.</p>
<p>And with those out of the way… our arsenal.</p>
<p>Mine is an M249 SAW light machine gun, which works pretty nicely when
I first tested it, and then the AvM Command Block Staff, which kind of
effectively gives me some form of “creative mode”.</p>
<p>As for Zen, what he got was a shotgun, called the Benelli M4
according to the knowledge shock he got, and the actual Supercharged
Gravity Gun from… I think it was the Half-Life series? That aside, based
on his testing on a ruined area he was in when he first woke up, it
could carry and launch pretty much anything that wasn’t bolted on the
ground.</p>
<p>…tanks included.</p>
<p>For Shin, what he got was a Type 56 assault rifle and… some sort of
handheld weapon which had the text “H.A.I.L HANDHELD ARTILLERY UNIT” on
it.</p>
<p>“Wait, Hail… artillery… Mindustry?”</p>
<p>According to him, Mindustry is a tower defense or factory simulation
game, based on the player’s preferences. The hail is apparently an
artillery weapon you could use in that game. Though, what confused him
the most was the weapon part, since, according to him, it’s supposed to
be an artillery <em>turret</em> instead of a handheld.</p>
<p>Oh, and the “artillery” part wasn’t a lie either, apparently. When he
tried it, the thing decided that the laws of physics doesn’t exist and
launched a standard artillery shell on his target, blowing it to
pieces.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I just… froze for a good 5 minutes after that.”</p>
<p>For Akira, what he got was a <em>hefty</em> sniper rifle called the
Barrett M82A1, which, based on what I know about the name, might be an
anti-material rifle. As for the other weapon, he got the Zenith from
Terraria. At first I was confused on what it was, but realized it
relatively quickly.</p>
<p>From the testing he did, apparently he has to swing it for the thing
to release swords. Though, when he first did that…</p>
<p>“Uh… I may have just almost pissed myself when the swords proceeded
to boomerang spin back to me.”</p>
<p>…yeah.</p>
<p>I also asked if it was heavy, but surprisingly, for its looks, the
thing was actually lightweight enough that he could swing it fast.</p>
<p>“I also found out that if I just spin like a tornado while holding
it, I can launch swords pretty much in every direction at once.”</p>
<p>…unfortunate apologies to whoever becomes our enemy. Except Kaiser.
Fuck them.</p>
<p>As for Levi, he got the M1216 shotgun, and… an actual Portal Gun, one
from the Portal series. From what we both remember, it should only work
on surfaces covered in conversion gel, surfaces made with moon rock, or
the moon itself. However, when he tried it…</p>
<p>“Wait, so it works on <em>any</em> surface now?”</p>
<p>“Any surface that’s flat and solid, like walls or solid ground, but
yeah, it just somehow works on anything now.”</p>
<p>…yeah, I don’t know anymore.</p>
<p>After a moment of thinking, Shin realized something.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Wait… so, we have a bunch of strong as shit weapons, right?” Shin
asks me.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” I answer.</p>
<p>“And we technically aren’t associated with any school, yes?” He
follows up.</p>
<p>“Uh… yeah? Where are you going with this?”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t we like… bomb the Kaiser PMC base without causing risks on
Abydos’ reputation?”</p>
<p>““““Huh?”““” Me and the other 3 make a surprised noise.</p>
<p>“Seriously, think about it. Our current arsenal is strong enough to
pretty much tear down entire bases easily. Plus, we have haloes too, so
bullets aren’t gonna do shit to us.”</p>
<p>“After letting time pass a bit, we could go raid the entire base and
flatten it completely. After that, if they try and associate us with the
school, we can just pretend to not know anything about them, and maybe
even damage their reputation for trying to put the blame on an already
dying school.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For a moment, silence.</p>
<p>“That’s… a solid plan, actually.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Because me and the others are kind of just unpredictable variables in
this place, with no associated school, and assuming we’re basically part
of this world now…</p>
<p><em>…we could intercept every major event and disaster without the
risk of bringing any negative reception to any school.</em></p>
<p>With basically zero connections to any school and even Schale, we
could pretend to just be some random rogues who intervene with major
things like the Kaiser’s attempt to fully consume Abydos, the impending
Arius attack during the Eden Treaty signing. And if we can last, maybe
even the Chroma invasion.</p>
<p>The only ones they can blame is us, but at the end of the day, we
don’t give a shit.</p>
<p>However, it still poses the risk of possible consequences for the
long-term future, so we’ll keep that idea shelved for now.</p>
<p>…except for the Kaiser destruction part. They can go eat the fucking
ground now.</p>
<p>“Alright, so that’s everything we need to know?” Levi asks me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that should be all.” I answer. “We should probably head back
to the girls now before they get any more suspicious of us.”</p>
<p>“I… can see that.” Levi says, realizing that. “Alright, let’s go
back.”</p>
<p>Me and the other 4 grab our arsenal, and leave the room.</p>
<p>“So this is what the building looks like in-person, huh…” Zen trails
off, looking around. Yeah, it’s pretty surreal being in a place that
only used to exist as images.</p>
<p>Though, as we try to find where the girls are, we fail to realize
something.</p>
<hr />
<p>“…” Hoshino looks back at the group, staying silent.</p>
<p>She had accidentally heard the entire conversation between the 5 of
them, and realized…</p>
<p>“…how do they know everything?” She muses to herself.</p>
<p>Factoring in the part she heard about destroying Kaiser, she quickly
realized that they also hate them as much as she does, but… that doesn’t
exactly mean they can be easily trusted.</p>
<p><strong>She already learned about what happens if you become too
trusting of anyone, after all.</strong></p>
<p>However, she did remember one part of the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>They were willing to destroy Kaiser PMC and pretend to know
nothing about Abydos so she and her kouhais wouldn’t be affected, going
as far as to even provoke them if they ever plan to blame the
school.</strong></p>
<p>…she’s conflicted. Are they doing this just for the sake of helping
her, or do they plan on wanting compensation for their actions?</p>
<p>For now, she’ll keep the realizations to herself, but, once the
opportunity shows soon…</p>
<p>…she’ll be the one to confront them about it.</p>
<p>She wants- no, <em>needs</em> to know.</p>
<p><strong>About what they know. What they want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And about what will happen in the future.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Well… that concludes the second section of this story.</p>
<p>Hoshino now knows that we know what has happened, and what will
happen in the future.</p>
<p>You already saw what she plans to do, but when will she act?</p>
<p>Well, we’ll see that in the future.</p>
<p>See you in the next telling of this story.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hmm? What about the others in Gehenna, Trinity, and Millennium?</p>
<p>Well, as I said, you’ll see. Eventually.</p>
