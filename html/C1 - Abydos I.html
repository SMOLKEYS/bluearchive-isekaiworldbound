</header>
<p>Kofumi Enzo here.</p>
<p>So… isekai.</p>
<p>Love it or hate it, it’s the most common genre you often see in manga
and anime.</p>
<p>To simplify it, it’s basically just the story protagonist being
reincarnated as an existing character or new character in an entirely
different world, which usually has magic. Depending on the story lore,
it’s either caused by law of nature, or through manual intervention by a
god when the protagonist dies in his original world.</p>
<p>So, why am I talking about it?</p>
<p>Well… turns out it’s apparently real.</p>
<p>And it also turns out the roster includes ALL types of worlds.</p>
<p>…Blue Archive included.</p>
<hr />
<p>I stand near the entrance of Abydos High School, stuck dealing with a
<em>minor</em> issue.</p>
<p>“Could you get out of that bunker thing already!?” Serika shouts
angrily at my direction.</p>
<p>“I’ll consider it if you stop pointing your guns at me, catgirl!” I
shout back through the small hole I made in this cobblestone block
bunker, not mentioning her name.</p>
<p>“How did you even make that thing?!” She asks, still shouting.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me! I don’t know either!” I shout back, lying.</p>
<p>Right now, my situation is staying inside this bunker, while waiting
for the Abydos girls to lower their guns so I don’t end up getting
punked in the face with lead.</p>
<p>In the hour that passed when I first arrived here, I realized many
things.</p>
<p>One: I’m now in the world of Blue Archive, specifically, Kivotos, and
more specifically, Abydos. Based on my current dilemma, the timeline
might be on Volume I, either before or after Sensei had made his first
appearance to the FTF.</p>
<p>Two: I have a halo, effectively making me as durable as the people
here. The halo in question resembles a simple star system, one star in
the middle and three planets orbiting it. The outermost planet has a
light blue color like Earth’s, the middle has a green color (Exoplanet,
perhaps?), and the innermost planet has a red color, something akin to
Mars. At the very middle is a white star with a red glow, probably a red
giant, keeping everything stable.</p>
<p>Why a star system? I don’t know. Probably has something to do with me
being a bit of a space geek.</p>
<p>Oh, and the planets actually orbit around the star in real-time in
different speeds, leaving behind a fading white trail.</p>
<p>…actually, hold on. I’m pretty sure students can’t see the details of
their own or other’s haloes. Odd.</p>
<p>Three: I’ve been given weapons. Specifically, an M249 SAW light
machine gun, which I now know how to operate after a memory surge struck
me when I picked it up, and, much to my absolute confusion, the goddamn
Command Block Staff from the Animation vs Minecraft series I’ve been
watching a lot. I tried both out for a bit, and got my grip relatively
quickly on both of them. With the staff in my hands, I also gained
access to the Minecraft inventory, which I could navigate by literally
doing the same thing the stick figures do to use it: Look up, see the
hotbar (which is apparently three-dimensional from my view), raise my
main hand, and move it forwards and backwards to scroll.</p>
<p>Four: My current age and situation. Prior to my unannounced arrival,
I was an 18 year old going through life as usual. Now, though, I
regressed back by a two years, meaning my age is now 16 years old, based
on what I looked like when I found a mirror.</p>
<p>Five: The risk my situation holds. If my existence as a <em>male</em>
student is suddenly found out, it will probably spread throughout
Kivotos like an actual wildfire, putting all eyes on me. Realizing my
presence will be found out eventually and taking that one Blue Archive
fanfic to mind, I could most likely get the best outcome by reaching out
to Sensei, and joining Schale, maybe even becoming an Abydos student on
the way. Sensei’s existence could help cushion the impact of my own
existence being a thing when he inevitably broadcasts me around the
city. Sure, all eyes would still be on me, but the risk of me getting
kidnapped might be lessened. Though, if that doesn’t work, then I’ll
probably have to resort to the staff.</p>
<p>…why am I strangely calm about this?</p>
<p>Well, setting my situation aside, I focus back on my current
dilemma.</p>
<p>“Were you brought here by Kaiser?” This time, Shiroko speaks up, her
gun still pointed at my bunker.</p>
<p>“Who the hell is Kaiser supposed to be?” I ask back, hiding my
knowledge about this world. Hoshino raises an eyebrow at my
question.</p>
<p>“Do you think we’re gonna believe that lie?!” Serika shouts at
me.</p>
<p>“Uhm… Serika, please calm down…” Ayane speaks up, trying to calm down
the angry cat.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Shiroko hums, staring at my eyes intently.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>After 10 seconds and me slightly sweatdropping, she lowers her
gun.</p>
<p>“Nn. They can be trusted.” She says with a thumbs up. Thank god she
can read people well.</p>
<p>“Wha-” Serika immediately turns herself towards Shiroko’s direction.
“Shiroko-senpai! You can’t be serious, right?!”</p>
<p>“Hmm~” Hoshino hums curiously after also staring intently the entire
time. “Alright, here. If you don’t try anything suspicious, we won’t
shoot you, deal?” She bargains.</p>
<p>“You too, Hoshino-senpai?!” And another shout from Serika.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t my original intention anyways, but sure.” I say through
the bunker hole, accepting the deal.</p>
<p>“Alrighty~, everyone, you can lower your guns now.” She signals to
the others.</p>
<p>“Ugh… fine! But if you try anything funny, we’ll shoot you on sight,
got it?!” Serika threatens, lowering her gun and pointing her finger at
me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, got that the first time.” I say.</p>
<p>After confirming they all lowered their guns, I use the staff again
to break the bunker. The entire thing collapses into dust, then
disappears shortly after.</p>
<p>“Hmm, say… I’ve been curious, but how does that staff work?”
Surprisingly, Nonomi is the last to speak up, asking about the
staff.</p>
<p>“Again, as I said, I have no idea.” I answer. “Though I do know a few
things it can apparently do.”</p>
<p>“One of those things is, uh, this.”</p>
<p>I point the staff at myself, and apply the Jump Boost effect.
Immediately after, I jump, the boost making me reach 12 meters high.</p>
<p>“Eh?” Nonomi responds with a confused noise.</p>
<p>“U-he?!” Then Hoshino.</p>
<p>““Huh?!”” And then Serika and Ayane.</p>
<p>Shiroko just looks at me. I have a feeling I know exactly what she’s
thinking.</p>
<p>“What else can it do?” She asks after a short delay.</p>
<p>“Uh… a lot of things, actually. It can make you strong enough to
break anything with your fist, make you faster than the speed of sound,
make you invisible, instantly break anything in it’s path, and well, as
you saw, make you jump much, <em>much</em> higher.” I specify a nugget
of what this thing can do. Specifically, the parts that would interest
Shiroko the most, knowing her habits. “Thing is, it can make me jump
higher than what you just saw.” I add.</p>
<p>“Can it be used to rob banks?” She asks the million dollar question,
stars in her eyes. Her voice doesn’t show her emotions very well, bur
her eyes more than certainly do.</p>
<p>“Shiroko-senpai! No! Bad!” Ayane says, panic in her voice.</p>
<p>For some reason, I couldn’t help but smile a bit mischievously.</p>
<p>“You certainly can, actually. Makes it a hundred times easier.” I
answer.</p>
<p>“Hey! Don’t make it worse!” Serika shouts at me. So far, she’s been
just shouting at me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stars in Shiroko’s eyes intensify.</p>
<p>“I see…” She trails off.</p>
<p>While the cat and elf duo scold Shiroko, I spawn a block above my
head to block the sun.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh, if you don’t mind me asking… is there any other place we
can be other than, well, being below the sun?” I ask.</p>
<p>They don’t respond, a look of surprise on their faces instead.</p>
<p>Oh, right, I just spawned a <em>floating</em> block.</p>
<p>“…how is that thing floating?” Serika asks, normally instead of
shouting at me.</p>
<p>“…honestly, don’t ask me. I genuinely can’t explain.” I answer.
Minecraft physics is really just like that.</p>
<p>“Again, can we please be anywhere other than this place?” I say,
pointing at the sun.</p>
<p>“Hmm, alrighty then~ here, follow us.” Hoshino answers, signaling the
others to enter the school.</p>
<p>I follow them, finally getting out of the sun.</p>
<p>“Also, if you don’t mind us asking, what’s your name?” Nonomi
asks.</p>
<p>Hmm… yeah, it’s probably fine.</p>
<p>“Enzo. Kofumi Enzo. 16 years old. Nice to meet y’all.” I answer,
subsequently greeting them.</p>
<p>“Hmm, well, nice to meet you too, Enzo!” She responds back with
enthusiasm. “My name’s Izayoi Nonomi!” She follows up with her full
name.</p>
<p>“…Kuromi Serika. Again, try anything funny and we’ll throw you out!”
Serika is the second one to respond.</p>
<p>“Okusora Ayane, nice to meet you, Enzo-san.” Ayane responds next.</p>
<p>“Nn, Sunaookami Shiroko, nice to meet you too.” Then Shiroko.</p>
<p>“U-he~, nice to meet you too. Name’s Takanashi Hoshino.” And lastly,
Hoshino.</p>
<p>“Well, again, nice to meet y’all.” I say.</p>
<p>“Hmm… are you a male like Sensei?” Shiroko asks me out of nowhere.
Wait, did they not realize that?</p>
<p>“Huh? What kind of question is tha-”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am.” I answer, cutting off Serika.</p>
<p>The girls stop walking, and look at me.</p>
<p>“I see.” Shiroko responds simply.</p>
<p>“Wha- eh- huh?!” Serika stutters, processing what I just said.
“You’re an actual boy?!”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, always have been as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
<p>“Hold on, how is that even possible?! You have a halo just like us!”
She shouts again.</p>
<p>“Is that an issue?” I ask, pretending to not know anything for the
better.</p>
<p>“IT IS! There hasn’t been a case of a male student appearing like,
ever!” And again.</p>
<p>“…eh?”</p>
<p>“…all students in Kivotos are female, Enzo-san. The only other male
person is Sensei, but he doesn’t have a halo like ours.” Ayane speaks
up.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Initially, I wasn’t too shocked about it, but now that I realize the
weight of my situation… oh man.</p>
<p>“…okay, I think I see the issue now.” I say after a short delay.</p>
<p>“So, uh… what do we-”</p>
<p>“Oi! Enzo! Is that you?!” I get cut off by a familiar voice shouting
at my direction.</p>
<p>““““Eh?”““” The five girls make a confused noise.</p>
<p>“Huh?” I follow.</p>
<p>Turning back to the voice, we see…</p>
<p>…is that Zen? Wait, Shinchi, Akira and Levi too?!</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, turns out I wasn’t alone. In fact, it wasn’t just them too,
apparently.</p>
<p>But, that’s a problem for future me to handle. For now, the pending
issue in front of me takes priority.</p>
<p>All you need to know is that Gehenna, Trinity and Millennium will
also have some similar issues.</p>
<p>See you soon.</p>
