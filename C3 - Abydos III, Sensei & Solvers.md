And, again, you have returned.

Well, I'm not gonna keep you here for long.

...hmm....

...I wonder if Seia will intervene at some point.

As we walk around the building for a bit, we're filled with a sense of curiosity and empathy.

"Christ... things already looked bad in the images, but it's somehow even worse in-person." Shin says with a hint of sadness in his voice, looking around. "...say, how did the sandstorms even start and get this bad?" He asks to no one, leaving the question open.

"Honestly, I don't know. None of us do. From what I know, Abydos was already dealing with sandstorms even before the desertification started." I start, picking up on the question. "At some point, the sandstorms just suddenly started to progressively got worse and worse up until... well, you know." I implicitly refer to-

"...until the only ones left were Yume and Hoshino?" Shin finishes my thought.

"...yeah." I answer.

After a moment, we overhear a conversation between the Abydos girls, and... a male voice?

"Hold on, I hear someone else talking in there. Could that be Sensei?" Akira asks.

"...it might be." I answer after a short delay.

I listen in for a moment, and-

*THUD*

-immediately recoil back from surprise, hearing something crash into... something else.

"...I think we may be in the part after Ayane threw the desk up." I say, after a momentary delay.

"...yeah, I can hear that." Levi responds.

After a brief moment of Ayane scolding the others, I walk to the door and-

"Ah."

Before I could even knock, the door slides open, and behind it is none other than Nonomi.

"Hmm? Enzo-san?" She looks at me curiously.

"Uh... is everything okay in there?" I ask her. I mean, I already know what went down in there, but I'm trying to not look suspicious.

"Ah, um... ehehe, Ayane-chan got a bit angry with us." She answers with what I could honestly describe as a cute laugh. "Oh, that reminds me! Before we go... Sensei, meet Enzo-san!" She follows up, pulling me in the room.

"*Uh oh, well, here goes...*"

After pulling me into the room, I glance around for a brief moment, an odd sense of nostalgia reaching me.

"*So this is what the meeting room looks like in-person, huh...*"

I'm also met with a rather peculiar sight: Hoshino and Serika cheering up Ayane, Shiroko being, well... Shiroko, and-

"..."

"...uh... hi there?"

-none other than the man himself, Sensei.

"...huh?" The only response from him is pretty much confusion.

Somehow, I could feel a sorry gaze from Akira, saying "*Good luck explaining everything again.*"

...god damn it.

---

"*Enough explanations for one day, please...*" I muse to my own thoughts as we make our way to Shiba Seki Ramen.

"U-he~, that thing is really convenient, isn't it?" Hoshino says to Zen, as he uses the gravity gun to carry a flat wall of white wool blocks above our heads, acting as a sort of makeshift umbrella.

"It really is, honestly. Overhead morning sunlight sucks sometimes." He responds back.

...

"*Hmm... what kind of synergies can our weapons have?*" I think to myself.

As it apparently turns out, Zen's gravity gun is fully capable of also picking up Minecraft blocks. We found this out before leaving to Shiba Seki Ramen to cheer up Ayane after her outburst, while not very willing to deal with the sun.

For some reason, that synergy combo reminds me of [something](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gravity-gun), but I can't seem to put a finger on it...

Eh, whatever, probably not important.

After another bit of walking, we eventually reach our destination.

"*So, this is what the place looks like in-person...*"

As my thought process does its thing, a really nice aroma reaches my nose. "*Is that the ramen?*"

However, before I could even continue my thoughts-

*Grumble...*

-I hear my own stomach grumble loudly from hunger. At the same time, the other 4 also happen suffer the same fate.

...

"*...actually, when was the last time we ate something?*"

Looking back at the group, I notice the Abydos girls and Sensei looking at us.

"...when did you all last eat?" Sensei asks us, breaking the silence.

"I... uh... I don't know." Akira responds for us.
