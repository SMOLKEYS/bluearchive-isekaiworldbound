And, again, you have returned.

Well, I'm not gonna keep you here for long.

...hmm....

...I wonder if Seia will intervene at some point.

As we walk around the building for a bit, we're filled with a sense of curiosity and empathy.

"Christ... things already looked bad in the images, but it's somehow even worse in-person." Shin says with a hint of sadness in his voice, looking around. "...say, how did the sandstorms even start and get this bad?" He asks to no one, leaving the question open.

"Honestly, I don't know. None of us do. From what I know, Abydos was already dealing with sandstorms even before the desertification started." I start, picking up on the question. "At some point, the sandstorms just suddenly started to progressively got worse and worse up until... well, you know." I implicitly refer to-

"...until the only ones left were Yume and Hoshino?" Shin finishes my thought.

"...yeah." I answer.

After a moment, we overhear a conversation between the Abydos girls, and... a male voice?

"Hold on, I hear someone else talking in there. Could that be Sensei?" Akira asks.

"...it might be." I answer after a short delay.

I listen in for a moment, and-

*THUD*

-immediately recoil back from surprise, hearing something crash into... something else.

"...I think we may be in the part after Ayane threw the desk up." I say, after a momentary delay.

"...yeah, I can hear that." Levi responds.

After a brief moment of Ayane scolding the others, I walk to the door and-

"Ah."

Before I could even knock, the door slides open, and behind it is none other than Nonomi.

"Hmm? Enzo-san?" She looks at me curiously.

"Uh... is everything okay in there?" I ask her. I mean, I already know what went down in there, but I'm trying to not look suspicious.

"Ah, um... ehehe, Ayane-chan got a bit angry with us." She answers with what I could honestly describe as a cute laugh. "Oh, that reminds me! Before we go... Sensei, meet Enzo-san!" She follows up, pulling me in the room.

"*Uh oh, well, here goes...*"

After pulling me into the room, I glance around for a brief moment, an odd sense of nostalgia reaching me.

"*So this is what the meeting room looks like in-person, huh...*"

I'm also met with a rather peculiar sight: Hoshino and Serika cheering up Ayane, Shiroko being, well... Shiroko, and-

"..."

"...uh... hi there?"

-none other than the man himself, Sensei.

"...huh?" The only response from him is pretty much confusion.

Somehow, I could feel a sorry gaze from Akira, saying "*Good luck explaining everything again.*"

...god damn it.
